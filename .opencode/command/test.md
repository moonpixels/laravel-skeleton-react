description: Run all tests in parallel with compact output
---

Run the full test suite using Pest in parallel mode.

Execute: !`composer run test`

Analyze the results and report:
- Number of tests passed/failed
- Any failing tests with details
- Suggestions for fixes if there are failures

If tests fail, offer to use `@test-fixer` agent to automatically fix them.
